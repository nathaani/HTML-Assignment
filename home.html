        <h1>Welcome to 3D Printing</h1>
        <p>3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a revolutionary process that
            creates three-dimensional objects by layering materials based on digital models,
            offering endless possibilities in rapid prototyping, custom production, and even
            medical advancements. This technology has transformed various industries, from
            aerospace and automotive to healthcare and design, by enabling intricate, precise
            fabrication with remarkable efficiency.</p>
