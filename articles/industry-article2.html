                <h1>Past And Future Collide: Adidas 3D Printed Mc87 4D Golf
                    Shoes Channel ‘80s Vibes</h1>
                <p>Ada Shaikhnag</p>
                <p>Building on its 3D printed footwear portfolio, sports
                    equipment manufacturing firm Adidas has introduced
                    the MC87 4D, a
                    limited-edition spikeless golf footwear model.

                    What sets the MC87 4D apart is its incorporation of Carbon’s
                    Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) 3D printing
                    process. It boasts
                    the novel 4D midsole, marking the first time Adidas has
                    featured this technology in a golf shoe. The 4D
                    midsole is crafted
                    through a precise process that uses light and oxygen,
                    resulting in a lattice structure.
                    This structure is not just for aesthetics; it’s designed to
                    provide controlled energy return, says the
                    manufacturer.

                    “Over the last 18 months we’ve noticed golfers wanting more
                    vintage designs, and we’re in a unique
                    position where our archives
                    provide some amazing product inspiration as we continue our
                    mission to be the most progressive golf
                    brand in the world,” said Masun
                    Denison, Global Footwear Director, Adidas Golf. “We
                    challenged ourselves to combine the timeless
                    aesthetics from the past with the
                    technology of today, and MC87 4D was the perfect result.
                    It’s a very special silhouette, a first for us
                    in golf using the 4D
                    technology, and it will be one that golfers everywhere will
                    be excited about.”

                <h2>Carbon’s Digital Light Synthesis 3D printing technology</h2>
                <p>
                    3D printing company Carbon’s 3D printing technology uses
                    Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP)
                    technology and DLS. This
                    process uses digital light projection, oxygen-permeable
                    optics, and resins to produce high-quality
                    parts. The Carbon DLS process
                    allows engineers and designers to iterate faster and
                    radically reimagine their products by making
                    possible consolidated parts,
                    unmoldable geometries, and software-tunable lattices.

                    In 2021, Adidas maintained its enduring collaboration with
                    Carbon, resulting in the creation of the
                    4DFWD, a 3D printed midsole.
                    Employing the DLS 3D printing technology, Carbon worked
                    closely with Adidas designers on the development
                    of this running midsole.
                    The 4DFWD proved its prowess in mechanical tests by
                    generating up to three times more forward motion
                    compared to its predecessors.

                    Other applications using Carbon’s DLS technology include
                    Adidas’ 3D printed Futurecraft 4D shoes, sports
                    helmet lining, dental
                    models, casting, and implant guides through its FDA-approved
                    3D printable DENTCA resins and M2 3D
                    printers.

                <h2>Adidas MC87 4D golf shoe</h2>
                <p>
                    The MC87 4D, taking inspiration from Adidas’ archival
                    designs, presents a gender-neutral design and a
                    water-resistant
                    leather upper. Specifically, it draws its design cues from
                    the classic 1987 Tiverton model,
                    incorporating elements such
                    as wing tip styling, brogue stitch detail, and croc
                    texturing into the timeless leather upper.

                    With its 4D midsole, the MC87 4D offers superior pressure
                    absorption from various angles, efficiently
                    redirecting energy
                    back to the foot while delivering crucial support where it’s
                    needed. This not only enhances overall
                    comfort but also
                    elevates on-course performance, establishing the 4D midsole
                    as a defining feature of the MC87 4D.

                    To further enhance stability during golf swings, the MC87 4D
                    is equipped with a rubber spikeless outsole
                    featuring lugs that significantly improve traction and grip.
                    Adding to its versatility, the footwear
                    includes a removable kiltie, allowing for a customized look
                    and style.
