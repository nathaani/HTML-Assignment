                <h1>The 3-D Printing Revolution</h1>
                <p>Richard D’Aveni</p>
                <p>
                    Industrial 3-D printing is at a tipping point, about to go
                    mainstream in a big way. Most executives and
                    many engineers don’t realize it, but this technology has
                    moved well beyond prototyping, rapid tooling,
                    trinkets, and toys. “Additive manufacturing” is creating
                    durable and safe products for sale to real
                    customers in moderate to large quantities.

                    The beginnings of the revolution show up in a 2014 PwC
                    survey of more than 100 manufacturing companies.
                    At the time of the survey, 11% had already switched to
                    volume production of 3-D-printed parts or
                    products. According to Gartner analysts, a technology is
                    “mainstream” when it reaches an adoption level
                    of 20%.

                    Among the numerous companies using 3-D printing to ramp up
                    production are GE (jet engines, medical
                    devices, and home appliance parts), Lockheed Martin and
                    Boeing (aerospace and defense), Aurora Flight
                    Sciences (unmanned aerial vehicles), Invisalign (dental
                    devices), Google (consumer electronics), and the
                    Dutch company LUXeXcel (lenses for light-emitting diodes, or
                    LEDs). Watching these developments,
                    McKinsey recently reported that 3-D printing is “ready to
                    emerge from its niche status and become a
                    viable alternative to conventional manufacturing processes
                    in an increasing number of applications.” In
                    2014 sales of industrial-grade 3-D printers in the United
                    States were already one-third the volume of
                    industrial automation and robotic sales. Some projections
                    have that figure rising to 42% by 2020.

                    More companies will follow as the range of printable
                    materials continues to expand. In addition to basic
                    plastics and photosensitive resins, these already include
                    ceramics, cement, glass, numerous metals and
                    metal alloys, and new thermoplastic composites infused with
                    carbon nanotubes and fibers. Superior
                    economics will eventually convince the laggards. Although
                    the direct costs of producing goods with these
                    new methods and materials are often higher, the greater
                    flexibility afforded by additive manufacturing
                    means that total costs can be substantially lower.

                    With this revolutionary shift already under way, managers
                    should now be engaging with strategic
                    questions on three levels:

                    First, sellers of tangible products should ask how their
                    offerings could be improved, whether by
                    themselves or by competitors. Fabricating an object layer by
                    layer, according to a digital “blueprint”
                    downloaded to a printer, allows not only for limitless
                    customization but also for designs of greater
                    intricacy.

                    Second, industrial enterprises must revisit their
                    operations. As additive manufacturing creates myriad
                    new options for how, when, and where products and parts are
                    fabricated, what network of supply chain
                    assets and what mix of old and new processes will be
                    optimal?

                    Third, leaders must consider the strategic implications as
                    whole commercial ecosystems begin to form
                    around the new realities of 3-D printing. Much has been made
                    of the potential for large swaths of the
                    manufacturing sector to atomize into an untold number of
                    small “makers.” But that vision tends to
                    obscure a surer and more important development: To permit
                    the integration of activities across
                    designers, makers, and movers of goods, digital platforms
                    will have to be established. At first these
                    platforms will enable design-to-print activities and design
                    sharing and fast downloading. Soon they will
                    orchestrate printer operations, quality control, real-time
                    optimization of printer networks, and
                    capacity exchanges, among other needed functions. The most
                    successful platform providers will prosper
                    mightily by establishing standards and providing the
                    settings in which a complex ecosystem can
                    coordinate responses to market demands. But every company
                    will be affected by the rise of these
                    platforms. There will be much jockeying among incumbents and
                    upstarts to capture shares of the enormous
                    value this new technology will create.

                    These questions add up to a substantial amount of strategic
                    thinking, and still another remains: How
                    fast will all this happen? For a given business, here’s how
                    fast it can happen: The U.S. hearing aid
                    industry converted to 100% additive manufacturing in less
                    than 500 days, according to one industry CEO,
                    and not one company that stuck to traditional manufacturing
                    methods survived. Managers will need to
                    determine whether it’s wise to wait for this fast-evolving
                    technology to mature before making certain
                    investments or whether the risk of waiting is too great.
                    Their answers will differ, but for all of them
                    it seems safe to say that the time for strategic thinking is
                    now.

                <h2>Additive’s Advantages</h2>
                <p>
                    It may be hard to imagine that this technology will displace
                    today’s standard ways of making things in
                    large quantities. Traditional injection-molding presses, for
                    example, can spit out thousands of widgets
                    an hour. By contrast, people who have watched 3-D printers
                    in action in the hobbyist market often find
                    the layer-by-layer accretion of objects comically slow. But
                    recent advances in the technology are
                    changing that dramatically in industrial settings.

                    Some may forget why standard manufacturing occurs with such
                    impressive speed. Those widgets pour out
                    quickly because heavy investments have been made up front to
                    establish the complex array of machine
                    tools and equipment required to produce them. The first unit
                    is extremely expensive to make, but as
                    identical units follow, their marginal cost plummets.

                    Additive manufacturing doesn’t offer anything like that
                    economy of scale. However, it avoids the
                    downside of standard manufacturing—a lack of flexibility.
                    Because each unit is built independently, it
                    can easily be modified to suit unique needs or, more
                    broadly, to accommodate improvements or changing
                    fashion. And setting up the production system in the first
                    place is much simpler, because it involves
                    far fewer stages. That’s why 3-D printing has been so
                    valuable for producing one-offs such as prototypes
                    and rare replacement parts. But additive manufacturing
                    increasingly makes sense even at higher scale.
                    Buyers can choose from endless combinations of shapes,
                    sizes, and colors, and this customization adds
                    little to a manufacturer’s cost even as orders reach
                    mass-production levels.

                    A big part of the additive advantage is that pieces that
                    used to be molded separately and then assembled
                    can now be produced as one piece in a single run. A simple
                    example is sunglasses: The 3-D process allows
                    the porosity and mixture of plastics to vary in different
                    areas of the frame. The earpieces come out
                    soft and flexible, while the rims holding the lenses are
                    hard. No assembly required.

                    Printing parts and products also allows them to be designed
                    with more-complex architectures, such as
                    honeycombing within steel panels or geometries previously
                    too fine to mill. Complex mechanical parts—an
                    encased set of gears, for example—can be made without
                    assembly. Additive methods can be used to combine
                    parts and generate far more interior detailing. That’s why
                    GE Aviation has switched to printing the fuel
                    nozzles of certain jet engines. It expects to churn out more
                    than 45,000 of the same design a year, so
                    one might assume that conventional manufacturing methods
                    would be more suitable. But printing technology
                    allows a nozzle that used to be assembled from 20 separately
                    cast parts to be fabricated in one piece.
                    GE says this will cut the cost of manufacturing by 75%.

                    Additive manufacturing can also use multiple printer jets to
                    lay down different materials
                    simultaneously. Thus Optomec and other companies are
                    developing conductive materials and methods of
                    printing microbatteries and electronic circuits directly
                    into or onto the surfaces of consumer
                    electronic devices. Additional applications include medical
                    equipment, transportation assets, aerospace
                    components, measurement devices, telecom infrastructure, and
                    many other “smart” things.

                    The enormous appeal of limiting assembly work is pushing
                    additive manufacturing equipment to grow ever
                    larger. At the current extreme, the U.S. Department of
                    Defense, Lockheed Martin, Cincinnati Tool Steel,
                    and Oak Ridge National Laboratory are partnering to develop
                    a capability for printing most of the endo-
                    and exoskeletons of jet fighters, including the body, wings,
                    internal structural panels, embedded wiring
                    and antennas, and soon the central load-bearing structure.
                    So-called big area additive manufacturing
                    makes such large-object fabrication possible by using a huge
                    gantry with computerized controls to move
                    the printers into position. When this process has been
                    certified for use, the only assembly required
                    will be the installation of plug-and-play electronics
                    modules for navigation, communications, weaponry,
                    and electronic countermeasure systems in bays created during
                    the printing process. In Iraq and
                    Afghanistan the U.S. military has been using drones from
                    Aurora Flight Sciences, which prints the entire
                    body of these unmanned aerial vehicles—some with wingspans
                    of 132 feet—in one build.

                <h2>Three-Dimensional Strategy</h2>

                <p>
                    This brief discussion of additive manufacturing’s advantages
                    suggests how readily companies will embrace
                    the technology—and additional savings in inventory,
                    shipping, and facility costs will make the case even
                    stronger. The clear implication is that managers in
                    companies of all kinds should be working to
                    anticipate how their businesses will adapt on the three
                    strategic levels mentioned above.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Offerings, redesigned.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Product strategy is the answer to that most basic question
                    in business, What will we sell? Companies
                    will need to imagine how their customers could be better
                    served in an era of additive manufacturing.
                    What designs and features will now be possible that were not
                    before? What aspects can be improved
                    because restrictions or delivery delays have been
                    eliminated?

                    For example, in the aerospace and automotive industries, 3-D
                    printing will most often be used in the
                    pursuit of performance gains. Previously, the fuel
                    efficiency of jet fighters and vehicles could be
                    enhanced by reducing their weight, but this frequently made
                    them less structurally sound. The new
                    technology allows manufacturers to hollow out a part to make
                    it lighter and more fuel-efficient and
                    incorporate internal structures that provide greater tensile
                    strength, durability, and resistance to
                    impact. And new materials that have greater heat and
                    chemical resistance can be used in various spots in
                    a product, as needed.

                    In other industries, the use of additive manufacturing for
                    more-tailored and fast-evolving products will
                    have ramifications for how offerings are marketed. What
                    happens to the concept of product
                    generations—let alone the hoopla around a launch—when things
                    can be upgraded continually during
                    successive printings rather than in the quantum leaps
                    required by the higher tooling costs and setup
                    times of conventional manufacturing? Imagine a near future
                    in which cloud-based artificial intelligence
                    augments additive manufacturing’s ability to change or add
                    products instantly without retooling.
                    Real-time changes in product strategy, such as product mix
                    and design decisions, would become possible.
                    With such rapid adaptation, what new advantages should be
                    core to brand promises? And how could
                    marketing departments prevent brand drift without losing
                    sales?
                </p>
                <h3>Operations, reoptimized.</h3>
                <p>
                    Operations strategy encompasses all the questions of how a
                    company will buy, make, move, and sell goods.
                    The answers will be very different with additive
                    manufacturing. Greater operational efficiency is always
                    a goal, but it can be achieved in many ways. Today most
                    companies contemplating the use of the
                    technology do piecemeal financial analysis of targeted
                    opportunities to swap in 3-D equipment and
                    designs where those can reduce direct costs. Much bigger
                    gains will come when they broaden their
                    analyses to consider the total cost of manufacturing and
                    overhead.

                    How much could be saved by cutting out assembly steps? Or by
                    slashing inventories through production
                    only in response to actual demand? Or by selling in
                    different ways—for example, direct to consumers via
                    interfaces that allow them to specify any configuration? In
                    a hybrid world of old and new manufacturing
                    methods, producers will have many more options; they will
                    have to decide which components or products to
                    transition over to additive manufacturing, and in what
                    order.

                    Additional questions will arise around facilities locations.
                    How proximate should they be to which
                    customers? How can highly customized orders be delivered as
                    efficiently as they are produced? Should
                    printing be centralized in plants or dispersed in a network
                    of printers at distributors, at retailers,
                    on trucks, or even in customers’ facilities? Perhaps all of
                    the above. The answers will change in real
                    time, adjusting to shifts in foreign exchange, labor costs,
                    printer efficiency and capabilities,
                    material costs, energy costs, and shipping costs.

                    A shorter traveling distance for products or parts not only
                    saves money; it saves time. If you’ve ever
                    been forced to leave your vehicle at a repair shop while the
                    mechanic waits for a part, you’ll
                    appreciate that. BMW and Honda, among other automakers, are
                    moving toward the additive manufacturing of
                    many industrial tools and end-use car parts in their
                    factories and dealerships—especially as new metal,
                    composite plastic, and carbon-fiber materials become
                    available for use in 3-D printers. Distributors in
                    many industries are taking note, eager to help their
                    business customers capitalize on the new
                    efficiencies. UPS, for example, is building on its existing
                    third-party logistics business to turn its
                    airport hub warehouses into mini-factories. The idea is to
                    produce and deliver customized parts to
                    customers as needed, instead of devoting acres of shelving
                    to vast inventories. If we already live in a
                    world of just-in-time inventory management, we now see how
                    JIT things can get. Welcome to instantaneous
                    inventory management.

                    Indeed, given all the potential efficiencies of highly
                    integrated additive manufacturing, business
                    process management may become the most important capability
                    around. Some companies that excel in this
                    area will build out proprietary coordination systems to
                    secure competitive advantage. Others will adopt
                    and help to shape standard packages created by big software
                    companies.

                <h3>Ecosystems, reconfigured.</h3>
                <p>Finally comes the question of where and how the enterprise
                    fits into its broader business environment.
                    Here managers address the puzzles of Who are we? and What do
                    we need to own to be who we are? As
                    additive manufacturing allows companies to acquire printers
                    that can make many products, and as idle
                    capacity is traded with others in the business of offering
                    different products, the answers to those
                    questions will become far less clear. Suppose you have rows
                    of printers in your facility that build auto
                    parts one day, military equipment the next day, and toys the
                    next. What industry are you part of?
                    Traditional boundaries will blur. Yet managers need a strong
                    sense of the company’s role in the world to
                    make decisions about which assets they will invest in—or
                    mainest themselves of.
                    They may find their organizations evolving into something
                    very different from what they have been. As
                    companies are freed from many of the logistical requirements
                    of standard manufacturing, they will have
                    to look anew at the value of their capabilities and other
                    assets and how those complement or compete
                    with the capabilities of others.

                <h2>The Platform Opportunity</h2>
                <p>One position in the ecosystem will prove to be the most
                    central and powerful—and this fact is not lost on
                    the management teams of the biggest players already in the
                    business of additive manufacturing, such as
                    eBay, IBM, Autodesk, PTC, Materialise, Stratasys, and 3D
                    Systems. Many are vying to develop the
                    platforms on which other companies will build and connect.
                    They know that the role of platform provider
                    is the biggest strategic objective they could pursue and
                    that it’s still very much up for grabs.

                    Platforms are a prominent feature in highly digitized
                    21st-century markets, and additive manufacturing
                    will be no exception. Here platform owners will be powerful
                    because production itself is likely to
                    matter less over time. Already some companies are setting up
                    contract “printer farms” that will
                    effectively commoditize the making of products on demand.
                    Even the valuable designs for printable
                    products, being purely digital and easily shared, will be
                    hard to hold tight. (For that matter, 3-D
                    scanning devices will make it possible to reverse-engineer
                    products by capturing their geometric design
                    information.)

                    Everyone in the system will have a stake in sustaining the
                    platforms on which production is dynamically
                    orchestrated, blueprints are stored and continually
                    enhanced, raw materials supplies are monitored and
                    purchased, and customer orders are received. Those that
                    control the digital ecosystem will sit in the
                    middle of a tremendous volume of industrial transactions,
                    collecting and selling valuable information.
                    They will engage in arbitrage and mainide the work up among
                    trusted parties or assign it in-house when
                    appropriate. They will trade printer capacity and designs
                    all around the world, influencing prices by
                    controlling or redirecting the “deal flow” for both. Like
                    commodities arbitrageurs, they will finance
                    trades or buy low and sell high with the asymmetric
                    information they gain from overseeing millions of
                    transactions.

                    Responsibility for aligning dispersed capacity with growing
                    market demand will fall to a small number of
                    companies—and if the whole system is to work efficiently,
                    some will have to step up to it. Look for
                    analogs to Google, eBay, Match.com, and Amazon to emerge as
                    search engines, exchange platforms, branded
                    marketplaces, and matchmakers among additive manufacturing
                    printers, designers, and design repositories.
                    Perhaps even automated trading will come into existence,
                    along with markets for trading derivatives or
                    futures on printer capacity and designs.

                    In essence, then, the owners of printer-based manufacturing
                    assets will compete with the owners of
                    information for the profits generated by the ecosystem. And
                    in fairly short order, power will migrate
                    from producers to large systems integrators, which will set
                    up branded platforms with common standards
                    to coordinate and support the system. They’ll foster
                    innovation through open sourcing and acquiring or
                    partnering with smaller companies that meet high standards
                    of quality. Small companies may indeed
                    continue to try out interesting new approaches on the
                    margins—but we’ll need big organizations to
                    oversee the experiments and then push them to be practical
                    and scalable.

                <h2>Digital History Replicated</h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking about the unfolding revolution in additive
                    manufacturing, it’s hard not to reflect on that
                    great transformative technology, the internet. In terms of
                    the latter’s history, it might be fair to say
                    that additive manufacturing is only in 1995. Hype levels
                    were high that year, yet no one imagined how
                    commerce and life would change in the coming decade, with
                    the arrival of Wi-Fi, smartphones, and cloud
                    computing. Few foresaw the day that internet-based
                    artificial intelligence and software systems could
                    run factories—and even city infrastructures—better than
                    people could.

                    The future of additive manufacturing will bring similar
                    surprises that might look strictly logical in
                    hindsight but are hard to picture today. Imagine how new,
                    highly capable printers might replace highly
                    skilled workers, shifting entire companies and even
                    manufacturing-based countries into people-less
                    production. In “machine organizations,” humans might work
                    only to service the printers.

                    And that future will arrive quickly. Once companies put a
                    toe in the water and experience the advantages
                    of greater manufacturing flexibility, they tend to maine in
                    deep. As materials science creates more
                    printable substances, more manufacturers and products will
                    follow. Local Motors recently demonstrated
                    that it can print a good-looking roadster, including wheels,
                    chassis, body, roof, interior seats, and
                    dashboard but not yet drivetrain, from bottom to top in 48
                    hours. When it goes into production, the
                    roadster, including drivetrain, will be priced at
                    approximately $20,000. As the cost of 3-D equipment
                    and materials falls, traditional methods’ remaining
                    advantages in economies of scale are becoming a
                    minor factor.

                    Here’s what we can confidently expect: Within the next five
                    years we will have fully automated,
                    high-speed, large-quantity additive manufacturing systems
                    that are economical even for standardized
                    parts. Owing to the flexibility of those systems,
                    customization or fragmentation in many product
                    categories will then take off, further reducing conventional
                    mass production’s market share.

                    Smart business leaders aren’t waiting for all the details
                    and eventualities to reveal themselves. They
                    can see clearly enough that additive manufacturing
                    developments will change the way products are
                    designed, made, bought, and delivered. They are taking the
                    first steps in the redesign of manufacturing
                    systems. They are envisioning the claims they will stake in
                    the emerging ecosystem. They are making the
                    many layers of decisions that will add up to advantage in a
                    new world of 3-D printing.
