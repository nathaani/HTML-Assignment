                <p>Researchers from the Shape Lab at the Institute of
                    Architecture and Media at Graz University of
                    Technology have developed MyCera, a new fungi-based 3D
                    printing material.

                    Composed of clay, wood sawdust, and mycelium (the vegetative
                    part of fungi), MyCera has been developed
                    with the overall goal of reducing CO2 emissions and solving
                    global waste management problems.

                    This research project uses mycelium as an intelligently
                    oriented fiber reinforcement to improve the
                    structural performance of 3D printed unfired clay elements,
                    and allow for bio-welding of fired elements.
                    Because the mycelium-based material continues to grow after
                    being 3D printed, MyCera is said to offer
                    high-tensile strength and structural performance.

                    The research team’s findings, entitled “MyCera. Application
                    of mycelial growth within digitally
                    manufactured clay structures,” have been published in the
                    International Journal of Architectural
                    Computing.

                    “The overall research goal focuses on finding a viable,
                    long-term solution to the global problem of
                    waste management and CO2 emissions, which also affects the
                    building industry and construction waste
                    management,” the team explained in the research paper.

                    “The composite ‘MyCera’ shows notable structural properties
                    when compared to the same material mixture
                    without mycelium. […] It is assumed that the high increase
                    in tensile strength is caused by the growth
                    process that takes place after printing.”

                    The researchers added that “This kind of intelligent fiber
                    distribution could not have been achieved
                    with a non-growing material.”

                <h2>Mycelium-based 3D printing</h2>
                <p>
                    The Shape Lab team leveraged a Delta WASP 40100 Clay from
                    Italy-based 3D printer manufacturer WASP in
                    their research, successfully using the system to 3D print
                    with MyCera. According to the researchers, the
                    3D printer’s open system, scale, and ability to 3D print
                    with any past-based material make it
                    well-suited to the project.

                    Utilizing the Delta WASP 3D printer, the Shape Lab team
                    determined that, in addition to enhancing the
                    structural performance of the 3D printed clay, mycelium can
                    also be used to bio-weld various components
                    together.

                    The researchers successfully produced a number of structures
                    by placing 3D printed elements together in
                    a state where the mycelium continued to grow. Mycelium
                    fibers of still growing node elements could then
                    form connections through the expansion of a hyphal network.
                    As such, adjacent elements could be
                    successfully bio-welded together.

                    According to the researchers, this could have significant
                    implications for the construction industry,
                    replacing traditional concrete with the more sustainable
                    bio-based MyCera material. The team now plans
                    to conduct more research to further this goal.

                    “After accomplishing sufficient research [we can affirm
                    that] the proposed material composition could
                    replace cement-based binders,” the researchers claim. “To
                    verify the assumption of an advantageous
                    structural effect of grown fiber connections, a comparison
                    of mycelial fiber reinforcement and other
                    fibers that are commonly used to increase tensile strength,
                    such as basalt and glass fibers, is
                    planned.”

                <h2>3D printing with mycelium</h2>

                <p>
                    This is not the first time mycelium has been leveraged in
                    additive manufacturing.

                    3D Printing Industry recently attended AM Summit Denmark
                    2023, Scandinavia’s largest annual 3D printing
                    conference. Danish AM Hub, the event organizers, outlined
                    the I AM MSHRM project, an ongoing
                    collaboration with Bjarke Ingels Group.

                    This partnership has seen the design and part-construction
                    of a donut-shaped, sustainable temporary
                    structure. The structure’s frame is being 3D printed using
                    plastic waste, locally sourced sugarcane, and
                    cornstarch. The frames are then filled with mycelium to
                    create the walls.

                    “Instead of requiring 20 years to grow a tree, you can grow
                    mycelium paneling in 20 days or less,”
                    explained Catherine Huang, a Partner at Bjarke Ingels Group.
                    “This print, which is currently made of
                    recycled plastic, could also become a biomaterial and become
                    fully compostable. So at the end of life,
                    it goes back into the ground.”

                    Elsewhere, it was announced last year that London-based
                    design studio Blast Studio had developed their
                    own method for 3D printing with mycelium. The company used
                    the bio-based material to 3D print a living
                    architectural building column. Over two meters tall, this
                    biomass structure was designed to provide both
                    strength and the necessary growing conditions for mycelium.

                    According to Paola Garnousset, co-founder of Blast Studio,
                    the key goal of this project was to create a
                    multi-purpose structure that could be harvested for
                    mushrooms while also serving as a functional
                    building column.
