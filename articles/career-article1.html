                    Former President Barack Obama once said 3D printing has the
                    “potential to revolutionize the way we make
                    almost everything.” If you aren’t using the technology yet,
                    know that plenty of people are already using
                    it across a number of sectors. 3D printing had a global
                    market size of $16.8 billion in 2022, according
                    to Grand View Research. By 2030, that number is expected to
                    hit more than $72 billion.

                    As the 3D printing industry booms, what does this mean for
                    job seekers? There are many career
                    opportunities that have been created or are getting a boost
                    from the popularity of 3D printing. But
                    there are also pros and cons to consider before pursuing
                    one.
                </p>

                <h2>What is 3D printing?</h2>

                <p>
                    Rather than using ink and paper, a 3D printer uses materials
                    like plastic, metal or ceramic to create a
                    3D model. By using computer-aided design (CAD) files as
                    digital instructions to create an object, a 3D
                    printer repeatedly covers a work surface with layers of
                    material in precisely the right spots to create
                    a structure from scratch.

                    While 3D printing can be used for large-scale structures,
                    it’s most helpful in creating smaller,
                    customized parts or prototype components for various uses,
                    including automotive engineering and the
                    medical industry. With the versatility of 3D printing, it’s
                    a field filled with opportunities.
                </p>

                <h2>3D printing jobs</h2>

                <p>
                    The possibilities for working with 3D printing are
                    practically limitless. Consider these nine jobs if
                    you’d like to take your career in this direction.
                </p>

                <h3>1. 3D design</h3>

                <p>
                    3D printing relies heavily on designers who can take a
                    product idea and bring it to life. Thanks to its
                    growth, 3D printing is creating jobs for 3D designers at 3D
                    printing firms and in other companies as
                    part of creative teams and as freelancers.

                    3D printers are being used in many design disciplines, such
                    as product design, medical device design,
                    architectural visualization and entertainment design, said
                    Erol Gunduz, a former professor at New York
                    University’s School of Continuing and Professional Studies
                    (NYU-SCPS), which offers programs in 3D
                    printing, design and modeling.

                    To be competitive, job seekers should gain hands-on
                    experience in 3D technologies and stay current on
                    how companies are using 3D printing. For instance, recent
                    graduate student designers and researchers who
                    are familiar with 3D printing methods have the benefit of
                    knowing how to use the technology within their
                    design process, Gunduz explained.

                    “This gives them a significant advantage when looking for
                    career opportunities within creative fields,”
                    Gunduz said.

                    Salary range: $41,600 per year to $99,840 per year
                </p>

                <h3>2. 3D CAD modeling</h3>

                <p>
                    3D printing would not be possible without CAD experts who
                    have the skills to convert product designs
                    into digital blueprints that the printers need to fabricate
                    items. Along with product designers, there
                    is a demand for 3D CAD modelers.

                    “I see a lot more demand for CAD and 3D modeling jobs on the
                    horizon because of 3D printing,” said Alex
                    English, former owner of ProtoParadigm.

                    Although 3D CAD professionals are also needed to construct
                    models for mass 3D printing, they are
                    especially important for custom products.

                    “Bespoke manufacturing and custom prototyping both rely on
                    the user’s ability to conceptualize the
                    object they want and accurately create its digital
                    representation,” English said.

                    Consequently, 3D CAD modeling jobs require printing-specific
                    modeling skills, such as feature size,
                    geometrical constraints and knowledge of materials, English
                    added.

                    Salary range: $54,733 per year to $71,548 per year
                </p>

                <h3>3. Research and development</h3>
                <p>
                    3D printing is all the buzz but not just in the gadget
                    world. Just as the growing 3D printing industry
                    requires more product designers and CAD modelers, jobs are
                    opening up for forward-thinking research and
                    development professionals who understand the intersection of
                    tech and consumer products.

                    “While 3D visualization technologies have been used in the
                    past within various fields, such as
                    engineering and scientific agendas, many artistic and
                    consumer product industries, such as fashion
                    design and jewelry design, are beginning to take advantage
                    of 3D printing systems,” Gunduz said.

                    Companies need people who can find the best way to utilize
                    3D printing for consumer products at the
                    lowest cost possible.

                    “The ability to visualize a line of fashion accessories or
                    jewelry designs before committing to working
                    with expensive materials affords an advantage for companies
                    to reduce costs in development cycles,”
                    Gunduz said.

                    Salary range: $82,000 per year to $146,000 per year
                </p>

                <h3>4. Biological and scientific modeling</h3>
                <p>
                    3D printing is not limited to consumer products; it can
                    create many items that promote medical
                    advancement and save lives. It can also create drone and
                    defense equipment and possibly even space food.

                    Accordingly, the 3D printing industry needs more engineers,
                    designers and modelers who have a biomedical
                    or scientific background to innovate further and produce
                    highly advanced 3D-printed products.

                    “While all manner of designers will be able to print the
                    things they design, there will be a high end to
                    the market — particularly in medical, aerospace, military
                    and other high-precision or mission-critical
                    applications — for those that better understand the printing
                    technologies and how to design for their
                    strengths and limitations,” English said.

                    Salary range: $70,650 per year to $173,000 per year
                </p>

                <h3>5. Architecture and construction modeling</h3>
                <p>
                    3D printing is disrupting various industries, particularly
                    those that rely heavily on blueprinting or
                    prototyping. For the construction industry, this paradigm
                    shift has boosted the need for 3D modelers
                    that can replace current 2D construction planning solutions.

                    “In the architecture, engineering and construction
                    industries, 3D printing will redefine the production
                    of construction documents,” said Lira Luis, the principal
                    architect at Atelier Lira Luis LLC, a
                    Chicago-based architecture and design firm.

                    Instead of 2D CAD modeling on paper, 3D printing can produce
                    true-to-life models to better represent
                    what structures will look like.

                    “As the 3D printing process becomes more streamlined, it
                    could potentially eliminate the need for
                    construction documents and move directly to printing
                    full-scale mock-ups prior to construction of
                    structures,” Luis said.

                    Salary range: $77,289 per year to $107,000 per year
                </p>

                <h3>6. Education</h3>

                <p>
                    What good are these 3D printing jobs if no one has the
                    qualifications to fill them? To help close the
                    skills gap, some schools now offer 3D printing programs at
                    all grade levels. This opens up jobs for
                    educators who can teach the technical and business aspects
                    of 3D printing.

                    “From an educational perspective, many K-12 schools are
                    looking to 3D printing as a point of exposure
                    for students within the arts as well as scientific areas of
                    study,” Gunduz said.

                    Colleges and universities are also launching 3D printing
                    courses and certificate programs, such as
                    NYU-SCPS’s certificate in 3D printing rapid prototyping. The
                    teachers, of course, need to have a
                    background in the 3D printing industry. They also need
                    specific skill sets to teach specialized courses
                    and stay current on the latest trends.

                    “For educators, having an understanding of 3D modeling and
                    3D printing techniques will be invaluable, as
                    the culture of [fabrication] labs is starting to gain
                    support as an important aspect of education,”
                    Gunduz said. “Teachers with 3D modeling and fabrication
                    experience have a range of opportunities open to
                    them within educational programs looking to incorporate this
                    new technology.”

                    Salary range: $27,040 per year to $62,400 per year
                </p>

                <h3>7. Legal professionals</h3>
                <p>
                    Here’s more evidence that 3D printing is not confined to the
                    tech world: As a creative field, the
                    industry is wide open to legal issues, prompting a need for
                    more lawyers and legal professionals who
                    specialize in intellectual property (IP) rights.

                    “As 3D printing technologies advance and become more widely
                    accessible, it will be easier for infringers
                    to create, market and sell products that infringe patents,
                    copyrights and valuable brands,” said Julie
                    Matthews, an IP lawyer at Lathrop GPM. “As 3D printing
                    technologies advance, new business models will
                    emerge in which consumer products and their component parts
                    can be copied, modified, juxtaposed with
                    others and produced almost anywhere.”

                    As a result, there is an increased need for IP enforcement
                    actions and lawsuits, as well as expanded
                    services to monitor for infringements, Matthews explained.
                    Growth areas include IP ownership, scope of
                    rights, licensing, fair use and international rights. [Learn

                    Salary range: $86,000 per year to $240,000 per year
                </p>

                <h3>8. Startup companies</h3>
                <p>
                    Are you thinking of starting a new business? 3D printing
                    offers opportunities for innovation — not only

                    printing spans various technical and design
                    roles, many of which make great business ideas to support
                    companies’ 3D printing needs.

                    “As 3D printing technologies advance and become readily
                    accessible to home users, undoubtedly, this will
                    lead to new business opportunities for inmainiduals and
                    companies offering on-site and remote 3D printing
                    services, new product and industrial designers and
                    computer-aided design specialists,” Matthews said.

                    With 3D printing costing between $1,999 and $3,500, anyone
                    with 3D printing knowledge can start such a
                    business.

                    Salary range: $53,000 per year to $130,000 per year
                </p>

                <h3>9. Administrative roles</h3>
                <p>
                    3D printing companies don’t run on engineers and technicians
                    alone. As the industry grows, new and
                    established 3D printing companies need employees to keep
                    their businesses running smoothly. This
                    includes operations and administrative staff, analysts,
                    finance and sales professionals and retail
                    employees.

                    “The businesses that will spring up with new business models
                    centered on 3D printing will also have a
                    need for more common jobs that other businesses need, like
                    marketing, clerical, shipping, etc.,” English
                    said.

                    These jobs are opening up in all types of 3D printing
                    companies, including vendors, manufacturers and
                    retail stores.

                    Salary range: $76,000 per year to $140,000 per year

                        pieces for biomechanical tools. If someone can
                        design an object, they can 3D print it. All anyone needs
                        is a little bit of imagination, which makes
                        this an exciting field to work in.

                        Customized, targeted markets: There’s an endless amount
                        of items and devices that can be created
                        through 3D printing. Someone could build an Etsy shop to
                        sell simple, everyday 3D-printed items like
                        an ashtray or desk organizer. Replicas of statues and
                        buildings are possible, too, or bespoke,
                        finely tuned components to help build fully functioning
                        prosthetic limbs that help improve life for
                        people with disabilities. With clearly defined business
                        niches, there are great odds of achieving
                        success.

                    <li>Wide variety of opportunities: Because 3D printing is
                        still a relatively young industry, the entire
                        landscape is teeming with opportunity. It’s still early
                        enough for anyone starting a career in 3D
                        printing to become a recognized industry titan.</li>

                <h3>Cons of 3D printing careers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Material limitations: While 3D printing jobs do allow
                        for metals and plastics to be used, those
                        materials are usually very specific to particular 3D
                        printers and intended uses. Polycarbonate
                        plastics, metal powders and even carbon fiber are
                        available as options for 3D printing material, but
                        the specific grades used to fabricate an item can become
                        scarce depending on supply chain delays and
                        demand. That can cause business instability.

                    <li>
                        Difficult to scale: Depending on the size of a project,
                        a 3D printing job can take anywhere from
                        less than one hour to more than 10 hours. Because of the
                        time resources required for printing a
                        single 3D object, printing dozens or hundreds of items
                        could take more time than an organization is
                        equipped for and can quickly become an unsustainable
                        business model.

                    <li>
                        Health hazards: Materials used for 3D printing projects
                        often create fumes or may use metal powders
                        or solvents that can be harmful to skin, requiring
                        manufacturers to follow stringent safety
                        protocols. Several simple procedures like exposure time
                        limits and low-emission materials can help
                        mitigate harmful effects but meaningful safety
                        regulations are required.

                    beginner wanting to try something new for work, 3D printing
                    presents possibilities for anyone ripe for
                    professional growth. Even a background with seemingly no
                    connection to this technology, such as office
                    management, could lead to a job with a 3D printing company.
                    All it takes is finding the position that
