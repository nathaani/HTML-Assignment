                <h1>Invisible tagging system enhances 3D object tracking</h1>
                <p>Alex Shipps</p>
                <p>Stop me if you’ve seen this before: a black and white
                    pixelated square in lieu of a physical menu at a
                    restaurant.

                    QR codes are seemingly ubiquitous in everyday life. Whether
                    you see one on a coupon at the grocery
                    store, a flyer on a bulletin board, or the wall at a museum
                    exhibit, each code contains embedded data.

                    Unfortunately, QR codes in physical spaces are sometimes
                    replaced or tampered with to trick you into
                    giving away your data to unwanted parties — a seemingly
                    harmless set of pixels could lead you to
                    dangerous links and viruses. Researchers from MIT's Computer
                    Science and Artificial Intelligence
                    Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed another potential option:
                    BrightMarker, an invisible, fluorescent tag
                    hidden in 3D-printed objects, such as a ball, container,
                    gadget case, or gear. The researchers believe
                    their system can enhance motion tracking, virtual reality,
                    and object detection.
                </p>

                <img src="../img/MIT-BrightMarker.jpg"
                    alt="Phone tracking 3d printed objects">

                <p>To create a BrightMarker, users can download the CSAIL team’s
                    software plugin for 3D modeling programs
                    like Blender. After placing the tag within the geometry of
                    their design, they can export it as an STL
                    file for 3D printing. With fluorescent filaments inserted
                    into the printer, users can fabricate an
                    object with a hidden tag, much like an invisible QR code.
                    Users will need to embed their markers into an
                    object before it’s fabricated, meaning the tags cannot be
                    added to existing items.

                    The fluorescent materials enable each tag to emit light at a
                    specific near-infrared wavelength, making
                    them viewable with high contrast in infrared cameras. The
                    researchers designed two attachable hardware
                    setups capable of detecting BrightMarkers: one for
                    smartphones and one for augmented reality (AR) and
                    virtual reality (VR) headsets. Both have the capacity to
                    view and scan the markers, which resemble
                    glow-in-the-dark QR codes. Surrounding objects could be
                    obscured from view using a longpass filter,
                    another attachable piece that would only spot the
                    fluorescence.

                    BrightMarkers are imperceptible to the naked eye — and
                    unobtrusive, meaning they don’t alter an object’s
                    shape, appearance, or function. This makes them tamper-proof
                    while seamlessly embedding metadata into
                    the physical world. By adding a layer of connectivity
                    between data and physical objects, users would
                    have access to a more interactive experience with the world
                    around them.

                    “In today's rapidly evolving world, where the lines between
                    the real and digital environments continue
                    to blur, there is an ever-increasing demand for robust
                    solutions that seamlessly connect physical
                    objects with their digital counterparts,” says MIT CSAIL and
                    Department of Electrical Engineering and
                    Computer Science PhD candidate Mustafa Doğa Doğan.
                    “BrightMarkers serve as gateways to 'ubiquitous
                    metadata' in the physical realm. This term refers to the
                    concept of embedding metadata — descriptive
                    information about the object's identity, origin, function,
                    and more — directly into physical items, akin
                    to an invisible digital signature accompanying each
                    product.”
                </p>
                <h2>BrightMarkers in action</h2>
                <p>Their system has shown promise in virtual reality settings.
                    For example, a toy lightsaber with an
                    embedded BrightMarker could be used as an in-game tool to
                    slice through a virtual environment, using the
                    tag-detecting hardware piece. This tool could enable other
                    in-game objects for a more immersive VR
                    experience.

                    “In a future dominated by the AR and VR paradigm, object
                    recognition, tracking, and traceability is
                    crucial for connecting the physical and digital worlds:
                    BrightMarker is just the beginning,” says MIT
                    CSAIL visiting researcher Raúl García-Martín, who is doing
                    his PhD at the University Carlos III of
                    Madrid. “BrightMarker’s seamless tracking marks the start of
                    this exciting journey into a tech-powered
                    future.”

                    As for motion tracking, BrightMarkers can be implemented
                    into wearables that can precisely follow limb
                    movements. For example, a user could wear a bracelet with an
                    implanted BrightMarker, enabling a piece of
                    detection hardware to digitize the user’s motion. If a game
                    designer wanted to develop an authentic
                    first-person experience, they could model their characters’
                    hands after the precise tracking each marker
                    provides. The system can support users with impairments and
                    different limb sizes, too, bridging the gap
                    between digital and physical experiences for a wide user
                    base.

                    BrightMarkers could also be tracked across the supply chain.
                    Manufacturers on-site could scan the tags
                    at different locations to grab metadata about the product’s
                    origin and movements. Likewise, consumers
                    could check a product’s digital signature to verify ethical
                    sourcing and recycling information, similar
                    to the European Union’s proposed Digital Product Passports.

                    Another potential application: night vision monitoring in
                    home security cameras. If a user wanted to
                    ensure their possessions were safe overnight, a camera could
                    be equipped to watch the objects with
                    hardware designed to trace and notify the owner about any
                    movements. Unlike its off-the-shelf
                    counterparts, this camera wouldn’t need to capture the
                    user’s whole room, thus preserving their privacy.

                <h2>Better than InfraredTags and AirTags</h2>
                <p>
                    Doğan and his team’s work may sound familiar: they
                    previously developed InfraredTags, a technology for
                    embedding data on 3D-printed tags within physical objects,
                    which was nominated for a People's Choice
                    Best Demo Award at the 2022 ACM CHI Conference on Human
                    Factors in Computing Systems. While their
                    previous project only worked for black objects, users have
                    multiple color options with BrightMarker.
                    With its fluorescent materials, the tags are configured to
                    emit light at a specific wavelength, making
                    them much easier to isolate and track than InfraredTags,
                    which could only be detected at low contrast
                    due to noise from other wavelengths in the captured
                    environment.

                    “The fluorescent filaments emit a light that can be robustly
                    filtered using our imaging hardware,” says
                    Doğan. “This overcomes the ‘blurriness’ often associated
                    with traditional embedded unobtrusive markers,
                    and allows for efficient real-time tracking even when
                    objects are in motion.”

                    In comparison to Apple’s AirTags, BrightMarkers are low-cost
                    and low-energy. Depending on the
                    application, though, one potential limitation is that the
                    tags cannot be added to objects post hoc
                    currently. Additionally, tracking each tag can be hindered
                    if the user’s hand or another item in the
                    room obstructs the camera’s view. As a remedy for
                    potentially enhancing detection, the team recommends
                    combining this technology with magnetic filaments so that
                    the object’s magnetic field can also be
                    tracked. The markers’ detection performance could also be
                    improved by producing filaments with higher
                    fluorochrome concentrations.

                    “Fluorescent object tracking markers like BrightMarker show
                    great promise in providing a potential
                    real-world solution for product tracking and authentication,"
                    says Andreea Danielescu, director of the
                    Future Technologies R&D group at Accenture Labs. “In
                    addition to supply chain and retail applications,
                    they could also be used to verify the authenticity of
                    products, such as vegan handbags.”

                    “Immersive technologies require powerful scene understanding
                    capabilities,” says Google research
                    scientist Mar Gonzalez-Franco, who was not involved in the
                    work. “Having invisible markers embedded,
                    like the ones from BrightMarker, can simplify the computer
                    vision needs and help devices identify the
                    objects that are interactable and bridge the gap for the
                    users of AR and VR.”

                    Doğan is optimistic about the system’s potential to enmesh
                    metadata in our everyday lives. “BrightMarker
                    holds tremendous promise in reshaping our real-life
                    interactions with technology,” he notes. “As this
                    technology continues to evolve, we can envision a world
                    where BrightMarkers become seamlessly integrated
                    into our everyday objects, facilitating effortless
                    interactions between the physical and digital realms.
                    From retail experiences where consumers can access detailed
                    product information in stores to industrial
                    settings, where BrightMarkers streamline supply chain
                    tracking, the possibilities are vast.”
