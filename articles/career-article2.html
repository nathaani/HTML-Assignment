                <h1>Careers in 3D Printing</h1>
                <p>Mara Hitner</p>
                <p>It’s not just a fad. Explore how people are using 3D printers
                    in their careers and why it’s important to
                    teach the next generation about this growing technology.</p>

                <p>When speaking with teachers about their efforts to bring 3D
                    design and 3D printing programs into their
                    K-12 classrooms, the one pervasive question is still – why?
                    Teachers try to get funding from
                    administration and are asked – why do you need a 3D printer?
                    Administration springs funding on teachers
                    earmarked for 3D printers, and teachers ask – why do I need
                    to take time out of my classroom to teach
                    how to use a 3D printer? Teachers introduce 3D printing to
                    their classrooms and the parents ask – why
                    are you wasting my child’s time with some “fad”?
                    Answer – preparation for future jobs. And current jobs. ALL
                    the jobs. Medicine, video games,
                    architecture, manufacturing, product design, special effects
                    for TV and movies, automotive,
                    entrepreneurial efforts we’ve never even heard of (like
                    desktop 3D printers themselves were in 2011) and
                    more all require some form of 3D modeling skills. And the
                    tool of choice to fabricate those models in
                    reality – prototype or final product – is 3D printing.

                    Teaching simple 3D modeling software like Tinkercad in
                    schools not only prepares students to broaden the
                    scope of job opportunities they might not have considered
                    before, but the practice of designing
                    something in CAD software also covers core STEAM (science,
                    technology, engineering, arts, and math)
                    standards that need to be taught anyway.

                    Engagement is the unique factor here. Teachers need to work
                    especially hard with the current generation
                    to grab their attention and keep them engaged. Brains are
                    changing. There are more tactile learners and
                    kids that have various issues with paying attention than
                    ever before (even if that issue is being
                    distracted by the cell phone in their pocket.) Incorporating
                    3D design and 3D printing into the lessons
                    teachers need to teach anyway makes the lesson stick and the
                    classroom time more fun.

                    may not have thought about before which
                    require 3D modeling and 3D printing skills — medicine,
                    architecture, manufacturing, product design,
                    special effects for TV and movies, anthropology, automotive,
                    entrepreneurial — at MatterHackers.</p>
